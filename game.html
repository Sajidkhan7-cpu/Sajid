		<p>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[a][1] 
		are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter
		sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world 
		participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered 
		the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 teams, representing 
		sovereign states and territories, participating.[2] The Olympic Games are 
		normally held every four years, and since 1994, have alternated between the 
		Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year period.<br><br>
		Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games 
		(Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 
		8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded 
		the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first
		modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic 
		Movement (which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games)
		with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<br><br><img src="img47.jpg" alt="pic" align="left">
		The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has 
		resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include 
		the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games 
		for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the
		five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the 
		World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also
		endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has needed to adapt to a 
		variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur 
		rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism,
		as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating 
		at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate 
		sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the 
		cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during 
		the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics;[3] and 
		the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br><img src="img48.jpg" alt="pic" align="right">
		London was the first city to host the Summer Olympic Games three times. As of 2022, 
		Paris, Los Angeles, Athens and Tokyo have each hosted twice; Paris will host for
		the third time in 2024, followed by Los Angeles which will host the Games in 2028.
		[1] Only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games: Australia,
		France, Great Britain, Greece, and Switzerland. Great Britain is the only country to 
		have won a gold medal at every edition of the Games. The United States leads the 
		all-time medal count at the Summer Olympics, and has topped the medal table on
		18 separate occasions—followed by the USSR (six times), and France, Great Britain,
		Germany, China, and the ex-Soviet 'Unified Team' (once each).
